 * Partition table and disk geometry handling
 *
 * A single ioctl with lots of subfunctions:
 *
 * Device number stuff:
 *    get_whole_disk()		(given the device number of a partition,
 *                               find the device number of the encompassing disk)
 *    get_all_partitions()	(given the device number of a disk, return the
 *				 device numbers of all its known partitions)
 *
 * Partition stuff:
 *    add_partition()
 *    delete_partition()
 *    test_partition_in_use()	(also for test_disk_in_use)
 *
 * Geometry stuff:
 *    get_geometry()
 *    set_geometry()
 *    get_bios_drivedata()
 *
 * For today, only the partition stuff - aeb, 990515
