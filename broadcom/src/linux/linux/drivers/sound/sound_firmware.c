 *	The buffer is returned in *fp. It is allocated with vmalloc so is
 *	virtually linear and not DMAable. The caller should free it with
 *	vfree when finished.
 *
 *	The length of the buffer is returned on a successful load, the

 *
 *	Caution: This API is not recommended. Firmware should be loaded via
 *	an ioctl call and a setup application. This function may disappear
 *	in future.
