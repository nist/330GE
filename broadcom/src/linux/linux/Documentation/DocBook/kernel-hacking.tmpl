  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>
   Welcome, gentle reader, to Rusty's Unreliable Guide to Linux
   Kernel Hacking.  This document describes the common routines and
   general requirements for kernel code: its goal is to serve as a
   primer for Linux kernel development for experienced C
   programmers.  I avoid implementation details: that's what the
   code is for, and I ignore whole tracts of useful routines.
  </para>
  <para>
   Before you read this, please understand that I never wanted to
   write this document, being grossly under-qualified, but I always
   wanted to read it, and this was the only way.  I hope it will
   grow into a compendium of best practice, common starting points
   and random information.

  <title>The Players</title>

  <para>
   At any time each of the CPUs in a system can be:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     not associated with any process, serving a hardware interrupt;
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     not associated with any process, serving a softirq, tasklet or bh;
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     running in kernel space, associated with a process;
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     running a process in user space.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   There is a strict ordering between these: other than the last
   category (userspace) each can only be pre-empted by those above.
   For example, while a softirq is running on a CPU, no other
   softirq will pre-empt it, but a hardware interrupt can.  However,
   any other CPUs in the system execute independently.
  </para>

  <para>
   We'll see a number of ways that the user context can block
   interrupts, to become truly non-preemptable.
  </para>
  
  <sect1 id="basics-usercontext">
   <title>User Context</title>

   <para>
    User context is when you are coming in from a system call or
    other trap: you can sleep, and you own the CPU (except for
    interrupts) until you call <function>schedule()</function>.  
    In other words, user context (unlike userspace) is not pre-emptable.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     You are always in user context on module load and unload,
     and on operations on the block device layer.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    In user context, the <varname>current</varname> pointer (indicating 
    the task we are currently executing) is valid, and
    <function>in_interrupt()</function>
    (<filename>include/asm/hardirq.h</filename>) is <returnvalue>false
    </returnvalue>.  
   </para>

   <caution>
    <para>
     Beware that if you have interrupts or bottom halves disabled 
     (see below), <function>in_interrupt()</function> will return a 
     false positive.
    </para>
   </caution>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="basics-hardirqs">
   <title>Hardware Interrupts (Hard IRQs)</title>

   <para>
    Timer ticks, <hardware>network cards</hardware> and 
    <hardware>keyboard</hardware> are examples of real
    hardware which produce interrupts at any time.  The kernel runs
    interrupt handlers, which services the hardware.  The kernel
    guarantees that this handler is never re-entered: if another
    interrupt arrives, it is queued (or dropped).  Because it
    disables interrupts, this handler has to be fast: frequently it
    simply acknowledges the interrupt, marks a `software interrupt'
    for execution and exits.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can tell you are in a hardware interrupt, because 
    <function>in_irq()</function> returns <returnvalue>true</returnvalue>.  
   </para>
   <caution>
    <para>
     Beware that this will return a false positive if interrupts are disabled 
     (see below).
    </para>
   </caution>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="basics-softirqs">
   <title>Software Interrupt Context: Bottom Halves, Tasklets, softirqs</title>

   <para>
    Whenever a system call is about to return to userspace, or a
    hardware interrupt handler exits, any `software interrupts'
    which are marked pending (usually by hardware interrupts) are
    run (<filename>kernel/softirq.c</filename>).
   </para>

   <para>
    Much of the real interrupt handling work is done here.  Early in
    the transition to <acronym>SMP</acronym>, there were only `bottom 
    halves' (BHs), which didn't take advantage of multiple CPUs.  Shortly 
    after we switched from wind-up computers made of match-sticks and snot,
    we abandoned this limitation.
   </para>

   <para>
    <filename class=headerfile>include/linux/interrupt.h</filename> lists the 
    different BH's.  No matter how many CPUs you have, no two BHs will run at 
    the same time. This made the transition to SMP simpler, but sucks hard for
    scalable performance.  A very important bottom half is the timer
    BH (<filename class=headerfile>include/linux/timer.h</filename>): you 
    can register to have it call functions for you in a given length of time.
   </para>

   <para>
    2.3.43 introduced softirqs, and re-implemented the (now
    deprecated) BHs underneath them.  Softirqs are fully-SMP
    versions of BHs: they can run on as many CPUs at once as
    required.  This means they need to deal with any races in shared
    data using their own locks.  A bitmask is used to keep track of
    which are enabled, so the 32 available softirqs should not be
    used up lightly.  (<emphasis>Yes</emphasis>, people will
    notice).
   </para>

   <para>
    tasklets (<filename class=headerfile>include/linux/interrupt.h</filename>) 
    are like softirqs, except they are dynamically-registrable (meaning you 
    can have as many as you want), and they also guarantee that any tasklet 
    will only run on one CPU at any time, although different tasklets can 
    run simultaneously (unlike different BHs).  
   </para>
   <caution>
    <para>
     The name `tasklet' is misleading: they have nothing to do with `tasks', 
     and probably more to do with some bad vodka Alexey Kuznetsov had at the 
     time.
    </para>
   </caution>

   <para>
    You can tell you are in a softirq (or bottom half, or tasklet)
    using the <function>in_softirq()</function> macro 
    (<filename class=headerfile>include/asm/softirq.h</filename>).  
   </para>
   <caution>
    <para>
     Beware that this will return a false positive if a bh lock (see below)
     is held.

      Let's keep it that way.  Your code should be 64-bit clean,

      specific stuff, e.g. inline assembly should be cleanly
      encapsulated and minimized to ease porting.  Generally it

      the kernel tree.

 <chapter id="ioctls">
  <title>ioctls: Not writing a new system call</title>

  <para>
   A system call generally looks like this
  </para>

  <programlisting>
asmlinkage int sys_mycall(int arg) 
{
        return 0; 
}
  </programlisting>

  <para>
   First, in most cases you don't want to create a new system call.
   You create a character device and implement an appropriate ioctl
   for it.  This is much more flexible than system calls, doesn't have
   to be entered in every architecture's
   <filename class=headerfile>include/asm/unistd.h</filename> and
   <filename>arch/kernel/entry.S</filename> file, and is much more
   likely to be accepted by Linus.
  </para>

  <para>
   If all your routine does is read or write some parameter, consider
   implementing a <function>sysctl</function> interface instead.
  </para>

  <para>
   Inside the ioctl you're in user context to a process.  When a
   error occurs you return a negated errno (see
   <filename class=headerfile>include/linux/errno.h</filename>),
   otherwise you return <returnvalue>0</returnvalue>.
  </para>

  <para>
   After you slept you should check if a signal occurred: the
   Unix/Linux way of handling signals is to temporarily exit the
   system call with the <constant>-ERESTARTSYS</constant> error.  The
   system call entry code will switch back to user context, process
   the signal handler and then your system call will be restarted
   (unless the user disabled that).  So you should be prepared to
   process the restart, e.g. if you're in the middle of manipulating
   some data structure.
  </para>

  <programlisting>
if (signal_pending()) 
        return -ERESTARTSYS;
  </programlisting>

  <para>
   If you're doing longer computations: first think userspace. If you
   <emphasis>really</emphasis> want to do it in kernel you should
   regularly check if you need to give up the CPU (remember there is
   cooperative multitasking per CPU).  Idiom:
  </para>

  <programlisting>
if (current-&gt;need_resched)
        schedule(); /* Will sleep */

   </title>

   <para>
    <function>printk()</function> feeds kernel messages to the
    console, dmesg, and the syslog daemon.  It is useful for debugging
    and reporting errors, and can be used inside interrupt context,
    but use with caution: a machine which has its console flooded with
    printk messages is unusable.  It uses a format string mostly
    compatible with ANSI C printf, and C string concatenation to give
    it a first "priority" argument:
   </para>

   <programlisting>
printk(KERN_INFO "i = %u\n", i);
   </programlisting>

   <para>
    See <filename class=headerfile>include/linux/kernel.h</filename>;

   </para>

   <programlisting>
__u32 ipaddress;
printk(KERN_INFO "my ip: %d.%d.%d.%d\n", NIPQUAD(ipaddress));
   </programlisting>

   <para>
    <function>printk()</function> internally uses a 1K buffer and does
    not catch overruns.  Make sure that will be enough.
   </para>

     You will know when you are a real kernel hacker
     when you start typoing printf as printk in your user programs :)

    in Linux because after some time memory fragmentation in a running

    The <function>cpu_to_be32()</function> family (where the "32" can

   <para>
    There are two major variations of these functions: the pointer
    variation, such as <function>cpu_to_be32p()</function>, which take
    a pointer to the given type, and return the converted value.  The
    other variation is the "in-situ" family, such as
    <function>cpu_to_be32s()</function>, which convert value referred

    <filename class=headerfile>include/asm/smp.h</filename></title>
   
   <para>
    <function>smp_processor_id()</function> returns the current
    processor number, between 0 and <symbol>NR_CPUS</symbol> (the
    maximum number of CPUs supported by Linux, currently 32).  These
    values are not necessarily continuous: to get a number between 0
    and <function>smp_num_cpus()</function> (the number of actual
    processors in this machine), the
    <function>cpu_number_map()</function> function is used to map the
    processor id to a logical number.
    <function>cpu_logical_map()</function> does the reverse.

   <title><type>__init</type>/<type>__exit</type>/<type>__initdata</type>
    <filename class=headerfile>include/linux/init.h</filename></title>

   <para>
    After boot, the kernel frees up a special section; functions
    marked with <type>__init</type> and data structures marked with
    <type>__initdata</type> are dropped after boot is complete (within
    modules this directive is currently ignored).  <type>__exit</type>
    is used to declare a function which is only required on exit: the
    function will be dropped if this file is not compiled as a module.
    See the header file for use. Note that it makes no sense for a function
    marked with <type>__init</type> to be exported to modules with 
    <function>EXPORT_SYMBOL()</function> - this will break.
   </para>
   <para>
   Static data structures marked as <type>__initdata</type> must be initialised
   (as opposed to ordinary static data which is zeroed BSS) and cannot be 
   <type>const</type>.
   </para> 

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="routines-init-again">
   <title><function>__initcall()</function>/<function>module_init()</function>
    <filename class=headerfile>include/linux/init.h</filename></title>
   <para>
    Many parts of the kernel are well served as a module
    (dynamically-loadable parts of the kernel).  Using the
    <function>module_init()</function> and
    <function>module_exit()</function> macros it is easy to write code
    without #ifdefs which can operate both as a module or built into
    the kernel.
   </para>

   <para>
    The <function>module_init()</function> macro defines which
    function is to be called at module insertion time (if the file is
    compiled as a module), or at boot time: if the file is not
    compiled as a module the <function>module_init()</function> macro
    becomes equivalent to <function>__initcall()</function>, which
    through linker magic ensures that the function is called on boot.
   </para>

   <para>
    The function can return a negative error number to cause
    module loading to fail (unfortunately, this has no effect if
    the module is compiled into the kernel).  For modules, this is
    called in user context, with interrupts enabled, and the
    kernel lock held, so it can sleep.
   </para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="routines-moduleexit">
   <title> <function>module_exit()</function>
    <filename class=headerfile>include/linux/init.h</filename> </title>

   <para>
    This macro defines the function to be called at module removal
    time (or never, in the case of the file compiled into the
    kernel).  It will only be called if the module usage count has
    reached zero.  This function can also sleep, but cannot fail:
    everything must be cleaned up by the time it returns.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="routines-module-use-counters">
   <title> <function>MOD_INC_USE_COUNT</function>/<function>MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT</function>
    <filename class=headerfile>include/linux/module.h</filename></title>

   <para>
    These manipulate the module usage count, to protect against
    removal (a module also can't be removed if another module uses
    one of its exported symbols: see below).  Every reference to
    the module from user context should be reflected by this
    counter (e.g. for every data structure or socket) before the
    function sleeps.  To quote Tim Waugh:
